# Learning [tfjs-tsne](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-tsne)

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

**t-SNE** output coordinates with [`tfjs-tsne`](https://github.com/hchiam/tfjs-tsne) and visualization powered by [`tfjs-vis`](https://github.com/hchiam/tfjs-vis).

## Starting by testing out this repo

Run `yarn global add parcel` or `npm install -g parcel`, and then:

Using [`yarn`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-yarn): (triple-click to select all)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hchiam/learning-template.git && cd learning-template && yarn;
yarn dev;
```

Or with `npm`: (triple-click to select all)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hchiam/learning-template.git && cd learning-template && npm install;
npm run dev;
```
